            <h2>Ongoing use of tools and approach</h2>
            <p>In making my own basic static website i was happy with using Trello and Visual Studio Code. Trello was a
                good
                planning tool which allowed me to create cards on a website board and prioritise them so that i was
                aware of
                what work needed to be done and when by.</p>
            <p>Visual studio code (able to be used on Windows, Linux and macOS) allowed me to create html5 and css3
                files which
                I could test via live server and on different browsers such as chrome and safari.</p>
            <p>The IDE is a cut down version of visual studio premium or ultimate but still offers features which are
                better
                than code editors such as sublime and netbeans so the IDE did not need to be changed within the project.
            </p>
            <p>I particularly liked the intellisense feature for code completion and code hinting which I investigate
                and found
                was present for these languages. During the project I found I did not need to change my approach as the
                IDE had
                integrated Version Control with Git which makes life easier than using other tools like tortoise SVN
                outside the
                application and improves productivity which I have previously used. During the project IO learnt about
                side by
                side editing of html and css files and used this. I also discovered and used code management
                capabilities such
                as the format code capability which were beneficial.</p>
            <p>i am keen to see how the IDE performs with extra extensions for other languages such as SQL and PHP and
                see what
                features the IDE has in terms of database integration and coding and testing, debugging and the coding
                of more
                complex dynamic websites and applications e.g in comparison to licensed versions of visual studio and
                php storm
                as on more complex projects I suspect I may need to change my approach with using Visual Studio Code due
                to it
                being a cut down version of Visual Studio and perhaps being limited in features. I would probably also
                use Jira
                if I was working on an agile project.</p>

        <div class="flexbox flexboxEven">
            <h2>IT tool appropriateness</h2>
            <p>The IT tools of visual studio code, Trello were appropriate for the website project on the whole as
                it was
                possible to get what was needed done.</p>
            <p>Whilst it was nice to use Trello to gain more experience i felt that the amount of time invested in
                Trello
                planning was disproportionate to the project - a task list would have sped up the project together
                with some
                quick drawings as the assignment tasks were already in a pdf presentation. There was only me
                designing and
                developing. </p>
            <p>Whilst is was helpful to have exposure to visual studion code as the website is a basic static site,
                a simpler
                tool could have been used such as textpad or notepad could have equally have been used as the
                features used in
                visual studio code were limited during the project.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="flexbox flexboxOdd">
            <h2>Further project improvements</h2>
            <p>I would make some alterations to enhance the static website for my portfolio such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Add unique meta-tags that can drive traffic to my website.</li>
                <li>Connect social accounts back to your site so people will share, like, and comment on your work
                    to give
                    better traction and visibility to your work.</li>
                <li>Get testimonials/quotes about my work from others to get my skills endorsed</li>
                <li>Create fresh content and improve the language on the website</li>
                <li>Add more links to other project work</li>
                <li>Include the latest CSS trends on my website such as animation using SVG, skewing and
                    transforming elements
                    to make a lot of noise, using smart quotes, hover effects, masks and adding more of a theme to
                    my portfolio
                </li>
                <li>Add more responsive elements to the website so it is less boring for users and they stick around
                    rather than
                    leaving within 15 seconds. add a hit counter to be able to monitor use of the site. Gain and act
                    on feedback
                    from usability testing.</li>
                <li>Improve site accessibility: The site should be compatible with all devices (mobile, tablet,
                    etc.)</li>
                <li>Add some fun functionality to the website using javascript such as adding a dropdown on a blog
                    page to allow
                    different blog content to be displayed as more blogs are created.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="flexbox flexboxEven">
            <h2>Benefits and drawbacks</h2>
            <p>Developing software solo vs team effort: the decision should be based on whether it increases your
                work or
                decreases with team efficiency. With this project you could split the content and html pages between
                team
                members and have a dedicated ux person to do the css.</p>
            <p>As the building a website blog project is small and there will be a small number of people in the
                team or an
                individual doing everything in less time than a sprint would take in the business world the benefits
                of using
                collaborative tools would be less prominent in this instance. This is because the work can be split
                easily
                without much overlap and if the team worked in the same location could discuss things easily as the
                project was
                built with the aid of a whiteboard and the use of collaborative tools such as slack could be a
                distraction and
                the filling in of Trello could end up being a project overhead.</p>
            <p>My viewpoint is in a day to day team based project in a business environment with more than a couple
                of people
                and more than a handful of requirements collaboration tools and the Visual Studio Code IDE will be
                more
                beneficial with less drawbacks.</p>
            <p>Visual studio integration with git would help ensure that the features assigned to individuals could
                be
                integrated and version controlled and each developer could see both the integrated product as well
                as their own
                work. This is particularly useful for collaboration with the css person as each person creating a
                content page
                could use the same css classes in their own code and help the css person design individual id tags
                for specific
                areas of their page.</p>
            <p>Trello would ensure everyone is up to speed with what needs doing if a release manager or scrum
                master takes
                charge of the board and chases individuals to update and progress items. It is useful to have the
                Trello board
                nearby in standups so that progress of what has been done and what needs doing is available to the
                team if the
                agile way of working is used as in many companies developers will pick up and item and then put it
                back if there
                are any blockers (blockers being discussed during standup meetings).</p>

            <h2>Improving productivity and efficiency</h2>
            <p>My ideas about how to improve productivity and efficiency are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>positive, healthy, and distraction-free work environment</li>
                <li>Improving your documentation and keeping everything updated and prioritized will greatly help
                    your
                    development process</li>
                <li>Using technology that even automates these processes can be beneficial.</li>
                <li>Plan your project / development</li>
                <li>Determining patterns early on and writing modular code will help you to simplify your process
                    and increase
                    reusability.</li>
                <li>Consider using software that is purpose built for Agile teams</li>
                <li>Concentrate being on task, focused, and flexible</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="flexbox flexboxEven">
            <h2>Solutions to improve productivity</h2>
            <p>When working with agile, i would consider introducing and working with tools which would enable
                continuous
                integration such as Jenkins. Also ensure that there are sufficient environments and resources for
                this approach.
                Automated tests can be performed e.g. unit tests, regression tests and code integration issues can
                be spotted
                early and fixed. Enhancing productivity and decreasing team (in particular developer) downtime.</p>
            <p>I would use Jira rather than trello if it was available, split content and development into team
                feature cards
                and use slack or mattermost for team communication using multiple channels e.g. one for trello
                updates, one for
                process / requirements issues etc.. so that important information is not missed</p>
            <p>The projcts worked on have considered Trello as a planning tool and slack as a team collaboration
                tool. Visual
                Studio code as an IDE. However, time management hasn't been considered in relation to task division
                and how long
                each task takes according to the relative weighting of each task in a project. Time Doctor seems to
                accurately
                track how much time you and your team spend on each task, by offering precise reports, which, at the
                end of the
                day, helps to monitor work efficiency and productivity. This may be a useful tool to adopt.</p>
            <p>Eisenhower (available as an app) helps prioritisation between how urgent and how important they are
                and I would
                consider using in an ad hoc meeting with any team I would work with as a demo so everyone understood
                the
                importance of communication and decisions within the team on both an individual and team level.
                individuals may
                wish to use this themselves as a personally planning tool as it helps divide work or tasks into
                quadrants - Do
                First, Schedule, Delegate and Don’t Do making sure you finish your most important assignments or
                features within
                sprints.</p>

            <h2>Testing digital solutions</h2>
            <p>Software testing is necessary in order to test the quality of a product in terms of it does what is
                required and
                does not break, responds in acceptable time, is usable and can be installed and run in the
                environment where it
                was designed for.</p>
            <p>As there is a lot to prove in testing, there are many methods of testing. As this project is
                relatively small
                only a few methods will be described here.</p>
            <p>From a static testing point of view apart from this review, I would walkthrough the website with a
                peer (user) to
                explain what has been done against the requirements on the trello board to gain feedback.</p>
            <p>As the website is a static rather than dynamic website, there would not be much need for dynmaic
                testing and
                testing would take more of a visual testing approach as a whole. Whoever tests the website will be
                asked to show
                any problems (and the events leading up to it) to the developer so they can replicate test failures.
                The
                developer will focus on the cause of the fault and how it should be fixed minimising the time spent
                on the
                project.</p>
            <p>To test digital solutions consideration needs to be given to the different levels of testing which
                will be
                needed: unit testing, integration testing, and system testing.</p>
            <p>Unit testing tests the functionality of a specific bit of code, usually at the functionality level.
                In the
                website which has been produced we would check the menu navigation function works as expected. In
                more
                complicated websites we would check things such as popups, button presses and any action a user can
                make which
                results in a change of website function.</p>
            <p>Integration testing tests the interfaces between different bits (components) against a software
                design. Agile
                (iterative addition of features) and waterfall (big bang) will take approach this testing
                differently. In the
                static website just created we would check that the screens fitted together properly e.g. a grid and
                paragraph
                were located in the right place compared to the design. i.e we would test for any defects in the
                interfaces and
                interaction between integrated components (modules).</p>
            <p>System testing tests the whole system meets its requirements. This is most useful when software has
                been created
                to aid or help a business process. E.g. logon, input data, report data, email report. In the case of
                the website
                we would be looking at the navigation flow and that the website works as a whole and meets
                requirements and
                design.</p>
            <p>Acceptance testing can be done by users to check the audience for the software are happy it works and
                any defects
                which may not have been spotted are caught.</p>
            <p>Other common tests which may be used when modifications are made to the website could be regression
                testing,
                smoke testing, performance testing, compatibility testing (testing with different browsers and
                screens e.g
                mobile phones, tablets, pcs, macs).</p>
