            <h2>Project Planning</h2>
            <p>In the agile project, epics and features would be discussed and researched as the project was broken
                down into
                small self-contained units which can deliver value to a customer</p>
            <p> Planning would be incremental and iterative for each sprint considering velocity in prior sprints,
                changes to
                priorities, new features, or idel time that wasn't planned for</p>
            <p>I would encourage decisions on how much work could be fitted into a sprint timeframe e.g. with story
                points and
                planning poker where estimation is done by the team</p>
            <p>A tool such as Jira or Trello would be used to log and track progress of all the tasks. Velocity
                would be
                tracked.</p>
            <p>Daily standup meetings would be used to discuss what I did yesterday, what i will do today, what is
                in my way. A
                scrum master would take ownership to remove blockers.</p>

        <ul id="ulTitle">Methods
            <li>Decide on how the project is to be run - using a methodology such waterfall, agile or a hybrid
                approach such
                as advance.</li>
            <ol>
                <li>In the case of waterfall consider requirements, design, implementation, verification and
                    maintenance
                    stage methods to complete the project.</li>
                <li>For agile, consider the more iterative approach with stages of plan, design, develop, test,
                    meet,
                    evaluate in small sprint cycles giving rise to the benefit of early feedback from the
                    business
                    and
                    addressing of bugs.</li>

            <h2>Project Risks</h2>
            <p>Despite the best intentions and ever-evolving methodologies many digital projects still are not
                successful.
                Though agile projects seem more successful than traditional projects failures still happen for common
                reasons
                such as mis alignment of digital and business goals and lack of proper integration of new IT products
                into
                business operations.</p>
            <p>Lack of cross functional expertise, limited digital strategy, over ambition and fixed plans that don't
                account for change can also be risks to project failure. The inadequate understanding of business
                processes being a root cause of inefficiencies, unintended processes and unintended consequences.</p>
            <p>Life after implementation of digital projects should be planned, together with changes in
                process, training for teams and business units. People, data, processes, culture needs to be
                considered to mitigate risk of failure so a customer centric process should be embraced which
                allows digital projects to be continual as organisations need to improve and innovate
                consistently to thrive.</p>
