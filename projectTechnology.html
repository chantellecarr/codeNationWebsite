    <h2>Selecting and using IT systems and software</h2>
    <p>IT systems and software should be selected based on used to help rather than hinder. If a
        technology must be used for reasons of ‘internal politics’ and it isn’t really providing any
        benefits, a more commercial view should be used for assessment of whether to use tools.  
        The basis of selection and use of systems and software should include:
        <ol class="mainOl">
        <li>Understand the business needs of your client (why client needs) </li>
        <li>Identifying your project goals (what client needs)</li>
        <li>Choosing the right development technologies</li>
        <ol>
            <li>what works with the relations between the software and the people</li>
            <li>what is the quality, scope, deadline, budget </li>
            <li>Choosing the right platform for any </li>
        </ol>
    </ol>
</p>
    <h2>Use of technologies in projects</h2>
    <h3>Git and Git Hub</h3>
    <p class="selectToolsPara">Git source control is based on the centralised model. It has a feature Branch Workflow, allows
        distributed development, is well known in the software development community, allows fast
        release cycles and easy peer reviews. The only downfall is it does not support 'commits' across multiple branches or tags as a tool
        such as rational clearcase would for large programmes of work.
        Git hub is a highly available code repository which makes it easy to contribute to open source
        projects, showcase your work, track changes in your work through version control, allows
        collaboration with others and access to other's work. Unfortunately there is a drawback of
        pricing and security for some companies.</p>
    <h3>Team Foundation Server, Jira, Trello</h3>
    <p class="selectToolsPara">Team Foundation services, Trello and JIRA are good tools for both waterfall and agile projects.  Although TFS works well with both types of projects there is a high cost element in terms of
        licensing which has led to many company's not adopting it for agile development.  
        Trello is a simple, customisable kanban board for teams that want to work agile, but aren't
        implementing true agile development. JIRA is an project management tool for by-the-book agile
        teams that are building, fixing, and releasing software. Both Trello and Jira sync data with other business systems such as Slack, Github, confluence,
        gitBucket</p>
    <div class = "ulToolsContainer">
    <ul class="box1"> Jira
        <li>Pre-built workflows for task management can be used and adapted for speed (Scrum, Kanban,
            hybrid)</li>
        <li>Excels at supporting agile way of working (detailed project reporting, user story backlog,
            issue tracking)</li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="box2">Trello
        <li class=".trelloLi">Easy to learn</li>
