    <h1>Legal Guidelines and constraints</h1>
    <p>GDPR is a replacement for the 1995 Data Protection Directive and affects every company regardless
        of Brexit</p>
    <p>GDPR affects every company, in particular those that hold and process large amounts of consumer
        data such as technology firms, marketers, and the data brokers who connect them.</p>
    <p>If individuals begin to take advantage of GDPR in large numbers, by withholding consent for
        certain uses of data, requesting access to their personal information from data brokers, or
        deleting their information from sites altogether, it could affect the data industry.</p>
    <p>Some companies have already released a range of tools on web apps or web sites to “put people in
        more control over their privacy”, by unifying its privacy options and building “access your
        information” tools to let users find, download and delete specific data on sites. </p>
    <p>Companies have done this as GDPR provides individuals with more power to demand companies reveal
        or delete the personal data they hold </p>
    <p>Regulators are able to work in concert across the EU for the first time, rather than having to
        launch separate actions in each jurisdiction; and their enforcement actions will have real
        teeth, with the maximum fine now reaching the higher of €20m (£17.5m) or 4% of the company’s
        global turnover.</p>
    <h2>Copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h2>
    <p>When building a website it is important to consider intellectual property rights. Consideration should be given
        to aspects such as:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Logos / branding - registered trade mark rights and the law of passing off.</li>
        <li>Database rights - in relation to any database underlying the website.</li>
        <li>Copyright - text, design, graphics, data, website layout and any music, broadcasts, software and images.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Database and copyright are automatic rights.</p>
    <h3>Logos / Branding</h3>
    <p>It is important that there is authorised use of a registered trade mark on any goods or services identical with
        the goods or services specified on the register.</p>
    <p>'RTM’ is how intellectual property professionals refer to registered trade marks. The ® symbol denotes an RTM.
    </p>
    <p>'TM' or ™ is used in the UK to indicate a company or business is using something with a trade mark that is
        currently unregistered.</p>
    <h3>Database rights</h3>
    <p>If a set of data on a website comes within the definition of a database, it will be protected in its own right if
        there has been a "substantial investment" (financial, human, technical) in obtaining, verifying or presenting
        the contents of the database.</p>
    <p>Although there are permitted acts and rights only last for 15 years.</p>
    <h3>Copyright</h3>
    <p>The copyright, designs and patents act was introduced in 1988 to protect the investment of time, money and effort
        by the people who create original pieces of work</p>
    <p>Copyright prevents people from copying work, making an adaptation of work and putting this on the internet.
        Licensing can be granted so that you have permission to use copyright material for your own reasons. Copyright
        owners can make decisions regarding copyright e.g. they can declare images to be royalty free so it has no
        copyright issues or use a creative commons licence to allow certain uses of their work.</p>
    <p>Work can be protected in countries other than the UK through international agreements such as the Berne
        Convention.</p>
    <h2>Accessibility</h2>
    <p>People with cognitive difficulties, vision impairment or hard of hearing often have access issues with online
        content.</p>
    <p>The WAI (web accessibility Initiative) is to lead the web to it’s full potential to be accessible, enabling
        people with disabilities to participate equally on the web. It covers web content, authoring tools, browsers and
        other agents.</p>
    <p>WAI user agent accessibility guidelines (UAAG) and WAI-ARIA, the accessible rich internet applications suite of
        web standards help define accessibility standards can help us design and code web pages which overcome barriers
        for those with disabilities.</p>
    <p>Examples of how websites can be coded to remover access barriers include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Captions and other alternative for non text content - alternative text for images</li>
        <li>Making all functionality on a website available from a keyboard so a website does not rely on the mouse</li>
        <li>Transcripts for audio information provided on websites</li>
        <li>Text is readable and understandable</li>
        <li>Content is presented in different ways e.g. easier to see and hear</li>
        <li>Content appears and operates in predictable ways</li>
        <li>Users are helped to avoid and correct mistakes</li>
        <li>Content is compatible with current and future user tools</li>
        </ul>
